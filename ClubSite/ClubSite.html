                            The Chhayachitra (Photography Club) at IIIT Bangalore aims to capture each and every beautiful moment of the college's fests and celebrations. Nothing escapes our cameras! Every smile, every moment - whether it's of joy, or just relief from all the exhausting work and every group photo is caught by us. What better feeling can a photographer get other than the perfect click! While creating short films can be tiresome, we have loads of fun ! :)

                            We help each other in terms of techniques, skills and perspectives for better shots thus making the best out of ourselves as photographers. Although the club was founded in 2015, it is growing fast and gaining popularity.

                            Aikyam is the social wing of IIIT Bangalore that was started in 2008 by the students of IIIT Bangalore. It is an initiative taken to help the poor and the needy and understand our social responsibility.
                            <br><br>
                            What we do as part of Aikyam is plan ‘Aikyam Trips’ to visit orphanages occasionally and spend our day with the children there. We usually collect funds from the students in college before any trip. We buy the necessary items for the children there and also give the funds collected to the orphanage. We generally visit the ‘Desire Society’ - a home for HIV affected kids (aged between 3-15) , and ‘Swanthana’ - which is a home for mentally and physically challenged girls. Apart from this, we frequently collect articles like clothes, food and books from the students and donate them to the needy. For example, last year on Eid, we collected these articles and donated them to the Goonj society.
                            <br><br>                            
                            We also conduct activities in college to spread social awareness among the students. For example, we started two initiatives in 2016 - The Little Things and The Tiny Tales. The Little Things is an initiative where the students make a short video to convey their concern to protect the environment or to support a social cause. The Tiny Tales is another such event where the students write a line or two on what they think they can do for the society. We organise events to raise funds for donation. One such event was putting up a lemonade stall or pani puri stall during the college fest. We also help in organising blood donation camps at our college.
                            <br><br>                                                        
                            Last year, we celebrated Diwali as a family with all members of our staff. We invited them along with their loved ones to join us and organized games and fun-filled activities for them. We provided them with clothes and money given by the students, along with sweets and crackers so that they could mingle with us on the occasion.
                            <br><br>                                                        
                            Why do we do all this? We believe that ‘Unity is the secret of social progress, and service to society is the means to promote it’. We spread happiness and awareness. This is the place where we can do our bit for the society and be thankful for all that we have.
